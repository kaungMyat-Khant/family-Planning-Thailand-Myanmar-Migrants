	abstract = {Although sample size calculations play an essential role in health research, published research often fails to report sample size selection. This study aims to explain the importance of sample size calculation and to provide considerations for determining sample size in a simplified manner. Approaches to sample size calculation according to study design are presented with examples in health research. For sample size estimation, researchers need to (1) provide information regarding the statistical analysis to be applied, (2) determine acceptable precision levels, (3) decide on study power, (4) specify the confidence level, and (5) determine the magnitude of practical significance differences (effect size). Most importantly, research team members need to engage in an open and realistic dialog on the appropriateness of the calculated sample size for the research question(s), available data records, research timeline, and cost. This study aims to further inform researchers and health practitioners interested in quantitative research, so as to improve their knowledge of sample size calculation., This review aims to explain the importance of sample size calculation and to provide considerations for determining sample size in a simplified manner. Five elements essential in sample size calculation are discussed, and practical examples are used. This study aims to further inform researchers and health practitioners interested in quantitative research, so as to improve their knowledge of sample size calculation.},

Sekaran (2013) wrote:
"Roscoe (1975) proposes the following rules of thumb for determining sample size:
1. Sample sizes larger than 30 and less than 500 are appropriate for most research.
2. Where samples are to be broken into sub-samples;(male/females, juniors/seniors, etc.), a minimum sample size of 30 for each category is necessary.
3. In multivariate research (including multiple regression analyses),the sample size should be several times (preferably 10 times or more) as large as the number of variables in the study.
4. For simple experimental research with tight experimental controls (matched pairs, etc.), successful research is possible with samples as small as 10 to 20 in size."

	abstract = {Since last few years ago, people from Myanmar migrate into neighboring countries especially to Thailand. Although Burmese migration population was increasing in Phang-Nga province since 2000, there was no baseline data on contraceptive used by Myanmar migrant. This study was to determine the prevalence of contraceptive usage among Myanmar migrant married women of reproductive age in Takuapa District and Kuraburi District, Phang-Nga Province. The data from this study was collected by face to face interview using structured questionnaire in February, 2008. The sample size was 297 Myanmar migrant married women of reproductive age. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) among Myanmar migrant women surveyed was 80.1\%. Among the currently used methods, injectables and oral pill account for large proportion. Concerning the need of the respondents towards family planning and contraception, provision of low cost contraceptive, more information on family planning and family planning clinics were needed.},

	abstract = {An appropriate sampling technique with the exact determination of sample size involves a very vigorous selection process, which is actually vital for any empirical research. It is obvious that these methodological decisions would greatly affect the internal and external validity and the overall generalizability of the study findings. This paper has comprehensively updated the guidelines on sampling methods and sample size calculation, hence giving enough evidence that will be beneficial in assisting researchers to advance the credibility and statistical power of their research work. The differences between probability sampling techniques, including simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, and non-probability methods, such as convenience sampling, purposive sampling, and snowball sampling, have been fully explained. Probability is the only that can ensure the generalizability, while non-probability sampling is useful in exploratory situations. Another significant process is the determination of an optimal sample size, which, among other things, has to take into account the total population size, effect size, statistical power, confidence level, and margin of error. The paper contributes both theoretical guidance and practical tools that researchers need in choosing appropriate strategies for sampling and validating methodologically appropriate sample size calculations. In sum, such a paper sets the standard for best practice in research methodology that will drive reliability, validity, and empirical rigor across diverse studies.},
